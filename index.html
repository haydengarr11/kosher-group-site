            <p>
              Hello, we are the first Food and Preparation group for REL 340
              Religious Studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              We decided to create a website to show how the Kosher diet
              functions Religiously for insiders specifically about mixing beef
              and dairy.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          The Kosher Diet is a food diet that follows regulations for food
          consumption and food preparation methods. Not cooking or consuming
          meat and dairy together is a prevalent activity that insiders partake
          in when following the Kosher Diet. Individuals can choose to follow
          the Kosher Diet for any reason that motivates them, and some examples
          of this are health benefits, environmental benefits, and religious or
          cultural reasons. When preparing meals food products that contain
          dairy canâ€™t be cooked using the same utensils. There needs to be
          separate plates, silverware, pots, pans, and any other cooking or
          eating utensil. During the clean up portion of the food preparation
          process it is recommended to have separate sinks to wash utensils that
          have touched dairy and separate utensils for foods that have touched
          meat products. If this is not possible, preventing any dishes from
          touching the sink and then having separate drying racks is ideal.
          <br />
          &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; When consuming meat and dairy
          products, the mouth should be rinsed out with water, solid food or
          liquid should be consumed, and hands should be washed and cleaned.
          Insiders following the Kosher Diet can have a wait time in between
          consuming meat and dairy products that varies. However, the most
          common wait time is 6 hours. There are guidelines are the kinds of
          meats that can be eaten as well. Examples of meats forbidden to be
          consumed include pig and camel. Examples of meats that are allowed for
          consumption include deer, cattle, sheep, goats and bison. However,
          there are restrictions on how these animals can be slaughtered and
          prepared as well to follow Kosher guidelines.
